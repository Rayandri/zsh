# Zsh Everywhere™ – The most stylish shell virus

Welcome to **Zsh Everywhere™**, the only virus you actually want to catch.

Every time I touch a PC, a VM, a Raspberry Pi, or even a smart toaster…  
*BAM* 💥 the terminal turns into Zsh + Powerlevel10k, with my plugins and my pixel-perfect prompt.

## Purpose
Joyfully infect every environment I log into with **my** Zsh configuration.  
No way back. No negotiations.

## Installation
Once you’re in the target environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<youruser>/<yourrepo>.git
cd <yourrepo>
bash install.sh
````

That’s it. Restart your terminal and enjoy the style.

## What’s inside

* **install.sh**: Script that:

  * installs Zsh, Oh My Zsh, Powerlevel10k
  * clones my favorite plugins
  * copies my `config_p10k` into `~/.p10k.zsh`
  * updates `.zshrc` to force the config
* **config\_p10k**: my cleaned-up, optimized Powerlevel10k configuration.
